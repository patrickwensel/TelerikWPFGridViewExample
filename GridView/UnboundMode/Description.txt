This example demonstrates how to work with RadGridView in unbound mode. Unbound mode means that no ItemsSource is defined for RadGridView. Instead you can directly work with its Items property.

Add and remove items to RadGridView with the controls on the right. You can have RadGridView filtered, grouped, and sorted while doing this.
