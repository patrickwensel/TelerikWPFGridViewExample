This example demonstrates how to create a custom bound column which can be used in RadGridView. This is applicable when you want to create a custom editor for this specific column.

The custom editor in our case is Telerik RadDateTimePicker control. It allows to edit time part of a DateTime value.

The custom bound column derives from GridViewBoundColumnBase and overrides CreateCellEditElement returning our custom editor. Please note the way we create the binding 
for this control to enable validation. In addition example demonstrates how you can add custom property to the column (TimeInterval) and transfer it to "view" or "editor" element.
