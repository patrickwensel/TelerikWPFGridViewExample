This example demonstrates pinning (freezing) rows functionality of RadGridView. 
Available when GroupRenderMode is "Flat", all you need to do is set PinnedRowsPosition property to Top/Bottom. 
The default mechanism for pinning the rows is to hover over the RowIndicator element and click on the visualized PinButton.
