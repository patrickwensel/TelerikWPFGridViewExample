This example shows how Telerik GridView listens for changes made to the data source it is bound to. All changes of the data source are immediately applied to the grid. 

Note that this feature is only supported for data sources that implement the <b>INotifyCollectionChanged</b> (for the entire grid) or <b>INotifyPropertyChanged</b> (for grid cells only) interfaces.
