This example demonstrates the basic configuration options of RadGridView's Row Details feature. Row Details are often used when the data to be presented is much more than the space at hand allows. Row Details can also be used for providing a more convenient editing environment for the end-user. In this example, there are two alternative DataTemplates defined as static resources. You can change the RowDetailsTemplate on the fly from the "Details Template" radio group on the right. Furthermore, Row Details can be presented entirely outside RadGridView through placing a DetailsPresenter control to show the details of the currently selected row. You can also freeze the row details on horizontal scrolling.
