This example illustrates the customization capabilities of the row layout in Telerik GridView. To do this apply a control template to the rows and arrange the cells therein. The template has to arrange a number of GridViewCell controls which will contain the data values. This can be achieved by setting the <b>ColumnName property</b> of the cells to the name of the respective GridView column.
