This example demonstrates the EnumDataSource utility. Use this class when you need to bind a RadComboBox or a GridViewComboBoxColumn to an Enum. The EnumDataSource will return a collection of view models based on the Enum type supplied. Attributes such as DisplayAttribute and DescriptionAttribute will be read and stored in the view models, so that friendly names can be displayes in the combo-boxes.
