This example demonstrates the usage of the filtering API. The data engine allows developers to define their own declarative filter criteria. 
In this demo a TextBox control is used to filter the grid as you type. In the code behind the CustomFilterDescriptor class inherits the 
FilterDescriptorBase and overrides the CreateFilterExpression method to implement row filtering for the column set by the filter value given in the TextBox. 
Using LINQ expression trees allows filtering logic to be passed to query provider for more efficient processing.
